An understanding of linear algebra will help you better understand the underlying mathematics behind some machine learning algorithms.\n", "\n", "\n", "## Key Takeaways\n", "\n", "The goal of this section was to provide both a conceptual and computational introduction to linear algebra - one of the foundational concepts underlying most machine learning models. Some of the key takeaways include: \n", "\n", "* One use case for vectors and matrices is for representing and solving systems of linear equations\n", "* A scalar is a single, real number. A vector is a one-dimensional array of numbers. A matrix is a 2-dimensional array of numbers \n", "* A tensor is a generalized term for an n-dimensional rectangular grid of numbers. A vector is a one-dimensional (first-order tensor), a matrix is a two-dimensional (second-order tensor), etc.\n", "* Two matrices can be added together if they have the same shape\n", "* Scalars can be added to matrices by adding the scalar (number) to each element\n", "* To calculate the dot product for matrix multiplication, the first matrix must have the same number of columns as the number of rows in the second matrix \n", "* Operating on NumPy data types is substantially more computationally efficient than performing the same operations on native Python data types\n", "* It is possible to use linear algebra in NumPy to solve for a linear regression using the OLS method\n", "* OLS is not computationally efficient, so in practice, we usually perform a gradient descent instead to solve a linear regression\n"]}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3", "language": "python", "name": "python3"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.7.3"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 2}
